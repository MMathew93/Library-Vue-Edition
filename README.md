# library-vue-edition
I re-did the Library project to try and practice with a framework, my choice of framework being pretty obvious. Re-doing this project from scratch using Vue was so simple. It took me just over 2 hours to get it working and properly saving locally this time compared to my vanilla javascript attempt. I want to re-do several projects using a framework to continue practicing my familiarity at this point.
